# MERN BookMobile

## Description

The MERN BookMobile was created as a scalable full stack application that allows a user to search for and save books to their personal list. This application can be applied as a list of books already read, or a list of books the user wants to read in the future. All data is securely stored through MongoDB interactions powered by Apollo Server and GraphQL queries and mutations.

This project helped me to understand the MERN stack and the inner workings of Apollo servers and how to use GraphQL to route data to the database.
